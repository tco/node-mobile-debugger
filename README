A POC about an idea on howto debug mobile devices

HOWTO:

1. Depends on socket.io. Install it with "npm install socket.io" under server directory.
2. Add <script src="http://host:port/socket.io/socket.io.js"></script> and <script src="http://host/path/to/client/debugger.js"></script>
3. Initialize connection by creating the debugger object. "var debug = new Debugger();"
4. Start debugging by calling "debug.log(data, moredata, evenmoredata);"

PITFALLS:

"TypeError: Converting circular structure to JSON" from JSON.stringify which cannot hande circular references.

For example structures like this:
var a = {};
a.reference = a;

So you cannot log HTML Nodes or jQuery Objects.

If YOU have a simple solution that I could use, please send pull requests. Or if you think this idea is the dumbest
idea ever, please feel free to think so :)
